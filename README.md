# Minute Commute
## Don't waste time commuting






## Summary:
Help people find appartment/room rent information which has less commute time


## Purpose and most common use cases
when people search appartment rent informaton (on craigslist for example), they are usually only can limit the "miles from zip".
While distance is important, it is more critical that we need to consider the commute time (car, bus, bike, walk). Moreover, we can add more similar features in different versions, such as showing the time not only to the working location, but also other places (hospital, schools, grocery stores)


Combine these two:

## Data Engineering technologies


* Data: S3
* ~~（Preprocessing/data streaming: Kafka-Spark）~~(not enough large data set)
* Database: MySQL
* Web application UI: Flask


#### Scrapy apartment rental data from craigslist ->
from 5 areas in SF-Bay area(AREAS = ["eby", "sfc", "sby", "nby", "pen"]), each 20 newest results.

```
(venv) peng@ubuntu:~/myproject/apartment-finder$ python scraper.py
Fri Apr 27 13:04:27 2018: Got 96 results
```

#### -> Data saved in database (MYSQL/SQLITE)
```
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
...
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///listings.db', echo=False)
```

#### -> Google map API get the commute time (2500/day limit)

```
